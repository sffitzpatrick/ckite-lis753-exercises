      Exercise 06 Stylish Donuts!
    </h1>
    <p>Who doesnt love to indulge in the occasional doughnut or two? Many times,
       we find ourselves craving the sweet, fried, satisfying taste we get with
       bite of a freshly made Krispy Kreme or Dunkin doughnut. While were
       delighting in the taste of the deep-fried food, do we stop and consider
       how much were hurting our body? Chances are, no. When we fulfill that
       craving and consume the sugary dessert, it could contribute to a number
       of health risks like weight gain and diabetes. Instead, we should try to
       find other tasty, healthier treats to eat.</p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>Readers Digest Editors (2017) listed doughnuts as one of the<br>
        worst foods you can eat because they contain the unholy trinity<br>
        of unhealthy ingredients trans-fat, sugar, and refined flour.</p>

      <p>'What is a doughnut, or donut if you will? Its a small lump of dough,
       which was originally fried in fat. So you can see where the dough
        in doughnut comes from. The nut part is actually a different way of
         saying a small lump. Originally, the name of the treat was dough boy.

      Donut is a simplification of the original spelling, and as such its
       completely in the spirit of the American version of the English
        language. Noah Webster the godfather of American lexicography was a
         strong supporter of spelling reform. If you look at American English
          and British English today youll see that the former has a strong
           tendency to prefer the simpler spellings of words.'</p>
